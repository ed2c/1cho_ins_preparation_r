## Introduction

Welcome to this CEDA repository. The goal of this repository is to prepare the well-known 1CijferHO institution file into a data product that is suitable for visualisation. For an example of a dashboard build upon this data, see the [following CEDA repository](https://github.com/ed2c/1cho_ins_visualisation_tableau).

## Origins of data

This file is register data for each public educational institution that provides higher education, i.e. (applied) universities.

(recentely renamed ROD)

In this repository the raw data is enriched with data from the 1CijferHO 'EOI-Cohort' file, with definitions about degrees and dropout. Secondly, it is enriched with programme data from CROHO. Thirdly, the data is enriched with derived characteristics that facilitate visualization.
